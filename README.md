# MECH105_ALGORITHMS

This respository contains a collection of MATLAB algorithms I wrote for the Spring 2023 MECH 105 class at Colorado State University. Specifically, the folders shown contain the *.m* files of algorithms for false position root finding, LU decomposition of matrices, linear regression, and integration using Simpson's 1/3 rule, as well as "README" files that go more in-depth and demonstrate an example.
